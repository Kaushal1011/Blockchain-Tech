There are more chains each build for a different purpose and usecase that you can build you dApp on. Explore them and use the best one. Ethereum is mainsteam xP.

2 types of developements in blockchain:

1. Blockchain App Development: Blockchain software developers build decentralised applications or Dapps using blockchain technology. Their roles include: Development of Smart Contracts, Development of interactive front-end designs for Dapps, Backend development pertaining to Blockchain, Supervision of the entire stack running their Dapps. (Building an application and architecture that uses blockchains already built)
2. Blockchian Core Development: The core blockchain developers are primarily responsible for developing the architecture of the blockchain system. (Building parts for the blockchain that will be used by other people in their application)


List of Blockchain Keywords (Scrapped from popular projects on Devpost) that can be explored for building cool projects

- Web3: [Docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.0/getting-started.html) - The web3.js library is a collection of modules that contain functionality for the ethereum ecosystem.
- Ethereum: [Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) - Ethereum currently uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This means that anyone who wants to add new blocks to the chain must solve a difficult puzzle that requires a lot of computing power.
- Solana: [Docs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview) - Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Solana can process many more transactions per second, and has much lower transaction fees, than rival blockchains like Ethereum. Solana's native cryptocurrency, which has the ticker SOL, has a market capitalization of over $66 billion,2 making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. Solana is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain and also uses a new technology called Proof of History (PoH).
- Solidity: [Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) - Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
- Rust: [Refereable Repo](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/awesome-blockchain-rust) - Rust is a programming language that many people are using to build interfaces to blockchain. This should be helpful in both building Dapps and Core Blockchain.
- OEC (Web3) - [Docs](https://okexchain-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) okexchain The world's first trading chain: a decentralized, borderless, blockchain-based ecosystem for exchanging value
- Remix - [Docs](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html) A very cool ide that blockchain community seems to be using for development.
